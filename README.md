Hi there 👋🏻, I'm Paul  
===============================================================================================================================

Offensive Cybersecurity & AI Engineering Student  
-----------------

I'm a 22 yo engineering student from France. I’m passionate about **offensive security**, **vulnerability research**, and exploring the intersection with **machine learning**.
Most of my projects are private — either due to **ethical considerations** (offensive security) or **university policy** — but feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more. I'm always open to discussing tech, security, and clever exploits.

* 🌍  I'm based in Paris
